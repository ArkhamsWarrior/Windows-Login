# Windows-Login

This is a project that came to mind when considering some projects I can do that require some Javascript. I learned how to use the time through this project and apply
some of the Javascript DOM manipulation techniques I learned through some of the tutorials that I've watched and completed. 

For me to make steady progress, I had to break up the elements of the project into separate problems. The Date being its own problem, the background and layout of the login screen,
and the password entry box with the profile picture. 

I plan to add more elements to make this page more similar to the windows login page by incorporating some facts that correspond with the picture of the background image
and maybe add some links to sites that can provide more information on the figures in the images.
